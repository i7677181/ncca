\section{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\-:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classBoid}{Boid} \\*This class contains movement methods and behaviours for the boids }{\pageref{classBoid}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classBoidMath}{Boid\-Math} \\*This class calculates the distance between the boids }{\pageref{classBoidMath}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classMainWindow}{Main\-Window} \\*This class connects G\-U\-I with \hyperlink{classNGLScene}{N\-G\-L\-Scene} }{\pageref{classMainWindow}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classNGLScene}{N\-G\-L\-Scene} \\*This class draws all elements for the swarming simulation }{\pageref{classNGLScene}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classOctree}{Octree} \\*I have used this class for finding the neighbours of a boid in my swarming system. I have made small modification from the original class such as removing methods which were not necesarrily needed for the calculations }{\pageref{classOctree}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{classSwarm}{Swarm} \\*Class for creating the swarm, managing boids and their neighbours }{\pageref{classSwarm}}{}
